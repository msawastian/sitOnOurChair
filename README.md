# sitOnOurChair


Company landing page made during CodersLab bootcamp. 
Recreated to be as faithful to the template as possible with my current skills.

Uses HTML5, CSS 3 (mainly Flexbox) and JS ES5 with bits of ES6.

Site contents:
1) header with CSS-based dropdown menus,
2) image slider (wip),
3) image boxes with css animations, text box,
4) pricing plan picker with js-based css style switching,
5) chair price calculator,
