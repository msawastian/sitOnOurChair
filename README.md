# sitOnOurChair


Company landing page made during CodersLab bootcamp. 
Recreated to be as faithful to the template as possible with my current skills.
Uses HTML5, CSS 3 (mainly Flexbox) and JS ES5.

What still needs to be done is a bit of js behind the scenes:
1) working style switching for pricing plans,
2) chair price calculator.
